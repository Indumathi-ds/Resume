# Hi there, I'm Indumathi 👋

I'm a **Data Science professional** with an MSc in Statistics, passionate about turning data into actionable insights. I have hands-on experience in **Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning**.

I enjoy working on **statistical modeling, predictive modeling, data analysis, and data visualization**, and I love building **interactive tools and dashboards** that make data more understandable.

Currently, I'm seeking opportunities as a **Junior Data Scientist**, where I can apply data-driven insights to solve real-world problems.
